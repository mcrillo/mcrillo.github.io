I am a biologist interested in bridging the fields of ecology, macroevolution and palaeobiology to understand the mechanisms that generate and maintain biodiversity over large temporal and spatial scales. I have a theoretical ecology background and mainly use planktonic Foraminifera, a marine microfossil group, as a model system. I like (re)discovering ways to visualise data in R and greatly support open science. When I am not doing science, I like to climb and be in nature. 

Since March 2019, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, collaborating with Prof. Helmut Hillebrand and Prof. Michal Kucera as part of the [Ocean Floor Excellence Cluster of the University of Bremen (Reseach Unit RECORDER)](https://www.marum.de/en/The-Ocean-Floor.html). I obtained my B.Sc. degrees from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and moved to Europe in 2012 to follow the Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Evolutionary Biology (MEME) funded by the European Union. In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Ocean and Earth Science from the National Oceanography Centre Southampton, UK under the supervision of Dr. Thomas Ezard. During my Ph.D. I also worked at the Natural History Museum in London with Dr. Giles Miller re-discovering a forgotten planktonic Foraminifera collection.
