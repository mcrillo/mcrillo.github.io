{% include base_path %}

I am interested in bridging the fields of ecology, evolution and palaeobiology to 
understand how biodiversity changes across large temporal and spatial scales. I have a theoretical ecology background, 
and mainly use planktonic foraminifera, a marine microfossil group, as a model system.
